### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

> > mv : moves file type 'mv old_folder/file.txt new_folder'
touch :creates new file type 'folder/new_file.txt
rm : removes file
rmdir :removes directory
cat :displays content of file (eg, txt) within the terminal 
echo :allows you to create content and save it in file. (e.g., "I am learning" > file1.txt
find . -name "*.txt" -print : lets you look for file ending in '.txt'
find . -type d -name "SWC*" : finds the path to a file starting with SWC
command + n : opens new terminal 
control+c :allows you to abort process
control+d:closes file
grep new *.txt : prints files that contain the word 'new'
man xargs : gives documentation on function 'xargs'

### Q3.  More List Files in Unix  

Explore these other [ls options](http://www.techonthenet.com/unix/basic/ls.php) and pick 5 of your favorites:

> > ls -p :displays directories with /
ls -t : displays newest files (based on timestamp)
ls -r : displays in reverse order
ls -R : displays subdirectories
ls -d : displys only diectories 
---

### Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

> > allows you to build and execute commans and apply given command to series of items, in order

e.g., code below allows you to delete all files with 2014 in its name,  rather than doing it 
find . -name "*2014*" | xargs rm -rf
